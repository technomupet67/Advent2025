For Coding in 2025, made by Oli in December 2025

Step 1 :
Install Visual Studio Code (free coding environmemt from Microsoft)
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Step 2 :
Install Python3 (the actual language to be used for coding - a bit like GFA Basic)


Step 3 :
Install inside Visual Studio Code the JUPYTER NOTEBOOK extensions
This is to have the NOTEBOOK functionalities inside Visual Studio code when you open a *.ipynb file

Step 4 :
Notebooks are a way of coding inside CELLS. Each cell can be a bit of code or a function
When you run a CELL only that cell code is executed.
It is a great way to explore coding and learn step by step

I have included a few CELLs at the top of the notebook to explain a little the language basics
There are thousands of videos online to learn.
Have fun
